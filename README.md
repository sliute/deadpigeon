# Dead Pigeon

This is a sample of what you can find if you're a curious fox roaming through London. Or an envious squirrel. But beyond that thin veneer, it's also a Moodle plugin stub that saves you a few minutes when starting to write one.

## Installation

Just clone the repo inside of `local/` and let Moodle find it.

## Usage

Go to `/local/deadpigeon/view.php` to see whatever content you provided in `view.php`. Make any changes you need to turn it into something useful.
